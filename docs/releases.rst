Compatibility Notes
===================
- **Version 0.4.1**:

  The documented way to get the blogging engine from ``app`` is using
  the key ``blogging`` from ``app.extensions``.

- **Version 0.3.1**:

    The ``SQLAStorage`` will accept metadata and set it internally. The database
    tables will not be created automatically. The user would need to invoke
    ``create_all`` in the metadata or ``SQLAlchemy`` object in ``Flask-SQLAlchemy``.

- **Version 0.3.0**:

    - In this release, the templates folder was renamed from ``blog`` to
      ``blogging``. To override the existing templates, you will need to
      create your templates in the ``blogging`` folder.

    - The blueprint name was renamed from ``blog_api`` to ``blogging``.

- **Version 0.2.0**:

    In this version, ``BloggingEngine`` will no longer take ``config``
    argument. Instead, all configuration can be done through ``app`` config
    variables. Another ``BloggingEngine`` parameter, ``url_prefix`` is also
    available only through config variable.
